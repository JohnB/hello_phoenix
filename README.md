# HelloPhoenix

## Provenance
The first commit for this app was from exactly following the steps found at the [up-and-running page](
http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/up-and-running).

The second commit was also [directly from the docs](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/heroku)

I followed directions! Yay me!

## Starting your Phoenix app

  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.create && mix ecto.migrate`
  * Install Node.js dependencies with `npm install`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
